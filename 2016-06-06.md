Using the border property to build confidence in CSS styling and position
=============

This week we were asked to create a how-to positions like many of the ones we have used over the last few weeks.  Although I've been able to learn a great deal from these posts, an area I have found to be a bit lacking are tips and tricks for beginners to improve.

Coding is very much a language and the more you learn, the more it seems your preferences and style become apparent so I am sure it can be difficult to give tips that don't feel like your own preferences.

Today, I am sharing a small trick that has done absolute wonders for confidence in CSS styling.  

When we thinking of the elements we style in CSS, it is sometimes difficult to remember that we are dealing with trackable items on a page.  Although not always appropriate, CSS styling can be applied to practically any element on a page.Before I started using this trick, I was devoted a huge amount of time to fiddling in CSS and hoping what I was typing was actually having a page effect.

Ready to leave the world behind of blind styling behind? and start controlling your elements with confidence?  Let's do it!
