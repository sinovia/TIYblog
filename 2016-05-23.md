As people develop and learn, the motivators and approaches they apply to their own capabilities have been identified as their mindset.  Although learners can display a combination of both, the two types that have been identified are a fixed mindset and a growth mindset.


A growth mindset is characterized by the learner's ability to recognize their mind as a tool for learning.  It is a mindset that recognizes failure as learning and puts emphasis on potential ability.  A fixed mindset recognizes achievement and learning in more absolute terms.  Can/can't or will/won't statements are common within this mindset.  Natural skill and ability are more greatly relied on.

Although I did not know the terms for it specifically at the time, I can think of many instances where my past achievements and challenges have been marked by this mindset.  About a year ago, I started trying to learn ukulele.  Long story short I was not very good and did not seem to catch on the instrument very quickly.  Eventually I told myself that it was due to not having natural ability as a musician and gave up the instrument.  I see now that I approached this challenge with a fixed mindset and did not give myself adequate opportunity to grow.

My experience to learn how to code has been approached with much more of a growth mindset.  I have become more comfortable with failing and not knowing the answer.  I see every setback and challenge as an opportunity to grow and have been able to learn a lot more by believe in my potential and abilities to learn if I dedicate myself.
