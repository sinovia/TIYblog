Pair Programming

Pair programming is the a programming style that is characterized by two developers working together to develop code.  Typically they work on a single device or with two devices and mirrored screens.  One developer is the driver and handles the input side of the project while the other developer serves a navigator.  The navigator reads lines of code as they are input and offers insight to the process.  It is a high collaborative style of development, but it is believed by some that developers are less distracted and more productive when working in this style.


Since this style is so collaborative, special care needs to be taken within the team to create the kind of environment to foster efficient work and interpersonal success.  At the onset, pairs should determine who is going to be working in what role at what time and how often they will switch off so once developer is not dominating the role.  Maintain a clean work space and respecting personal space is essential.  Another important aspect of well executed pair programming is to set clearly define and reasonably scaled goals.

Pair programming still seems to be a bit of a controversial style of development.  While some developers speak volumes about its benefits for more efficient work, less error, and minimizing bad work habits, others show concern for its elimination of the private, individual brainstorming and writing that many accept as a part of their personal development style.
