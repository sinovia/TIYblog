Using the border property to build confidence in CSS styling and position
=============

This week we were asked to create a how-to positions like many of the ones we have used over the last few weeks.  Although I've been able to learn a great deal from these posts, an area I have found to be a bit lacking are tips and tricks for beginners to improve.

Coding is very much a language and the more you learn, the more it seems your preferences and style become apparent so I am sure it can be difficult to give tips that don't feel like your own preferences.

Today, I am sharing a small trick that has done absolute wonders for confidence in CSS styling.  

When we thinking of the elements we style in CSS, it is sometimes difficult to remember that we are dealing with trackable items on a page.  Although not always appropriate, CSS styling can be applied to practically any element on a page.Before I started using this trick, I was devoted a huge amount of time to fiddling in CSS and hoping what I was typing was actually having a page effect.

Ready to leave the world behind of blind styling behind? and start controlling your elements with confidence?  Let's do it!

*Install Pigments*
[](https://atom.io/packages/pigments)
There is a package on Atom called Pigments that allows you to see the colors you select within CSS.  

Download and install this package by going to your Atom preferences menu:

## You have now unlocked the power of CSS rainbows
  Any time you put in a color value in CSS, Pigments will display it.  Having a visual point of a reference for elements being styled makes it so much easier to target that element for styling.

Border property at work
I am currently building a Memory card game for a class project.  Cards mean LOTS of sections and lots of opporunities to get lost in my CSS.  How do I keep up with it all?

*PUT A BORDER ON IT!*

In this example, I want to make an adjustment to the card class in my styling.  With so many elements containing that word, it can be hard to identify WHICH element I was in my CSS.  Here's where a border comes in handy.

## But when we add a border
Let's add a border property to our card class.  Here, I gave the card class a 2 pixel solid border that is lime green.  I purposefully use bright colors I can more easily identify my element in CSS and on the page when it displays.  This makes no changes to the functionality of this element, it simply adds a more visible marker. Think of it as highlighting a page in a book.  **Can you tell which element I've identified?**

## Within my project

Again this does not at all affect the functionality of the cards within my app.  It just highlight them so I when I make adjustments in CSS, I know exactly what I am target.  While in progress, my projects can be an absolute rainbow, but I always know exactly what is being manipulated.  Once I have things positioned where i want them, I simply deleted that line in CSS and all of the other properties remain.

## One Last example
I want to reposition the lifebar at the top of my page.  If only there was a way to make them more visible....

## How can I make them more easy to find within CSS and on my page?
Could I?..... Should I?... Yes!  Yes!  I do believe I should...

## This element has been targeted
The gold highlight provided by Pigments creates a great visual reference.

## ... and is ready for styling!
I know exactly what element I am changing when I add properties in CSS.  No more guesswork!
